            <p>Hi! I am excited to be learning Web Development. I just recently quit my job as a RN to go back to school. I
                was a programmer many years ago, and then went into nursing, and am returning to development. I am married,
                have an 18 year old son and live in Chandler. We have 13 finches. I have lived in Arizona most of my life
                and went to ASU. I have a BS degree in Mathematics and and AS in Nursing. I enjoy learning new things and
                look forward to gaining new skills as I undertake the Coding Bootcamp! I'm enjoy challenges, learning new
                things. I am hoping that by the grace of God, I can be successful in this program. </p>
